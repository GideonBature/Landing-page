# Landing-page

This is a project given in the foundation section of the Full Stack Web Development section of The Odin Project, it was coded by me, Gideon Bature using flexbox and it's properties.
I started the project on the 20th of August, 2022.
First I worked on the HTML file, with the naming of classes and the HTML semantics.
Secondly, I worked on the styling for each section of the landing page.
I completed the landing page on the 21st of August, 2022.

Although, I might still come back to it as I make progress to come and effect some changes to make it look more unique later in the future.
